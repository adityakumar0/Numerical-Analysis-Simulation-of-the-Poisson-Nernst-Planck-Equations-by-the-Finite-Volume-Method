Interactive Exploration of Numerical Simulations of the One Dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) Equations.

The Finite Volume Method is used for the discretization of the PNP equations--a system of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations. 

The PNP equations are used to formulate a continuum description (point-like model of material bodies without considering atomic detail) of the diffusion of charged particles in a solvent influenced by an external electric field.
